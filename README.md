# Note From Gogo

GDKPs have risen in popularity in Classic WoW. This add-on is the most popular auctioning add-on, but doesn't seem to be well-maintained.

I'm taking this project over for popt1x, but there are several versions of GDKPd available for download on CurseForge.

I don't have any intent to make money off of this, I just want to fix it up for the current users.

The licenses are all over the place. If you're the original license holder and you have any issues with me working on this code, please reach out.

But barring someone requesting me to take this down, I'm going to fix it up enough so it works for the people who rely on it to distribute loot.
